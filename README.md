# Earthquake Magnitude Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project to predict earthquake magnitudes using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The model is trained on historical earthquake data from 1990 to 2023.

## Project Overview
The goal is to predict earthquake magnitudes based on features such as latitude, longitude, depth, and time (year, month, day, hour). The ANN is built using TensorFlow/Keras, with preprocessing via scikit-learn.

## Files
- **`ANN_Qk.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow:
  - Data loading and preprocessing of `Eartquakes-1990-2023.csv`.
  - ANN model training and evaluation.
  - Visualization of actual vs. predicted magnitudes on a geographical map.
  - Saving the trained model (`earthquake_magnitude_model.h5`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`).

**Note**: The model and scaler files (`earthquake_magnitude_model.h5`, `scaler.pkl`) are not included here but are generated by running the notebook.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow
joblib
plotly

## Usage
## Prepare Data:
Download the dataset Eartquakes-1990-2023.csv (not included due to size) and place it in the same directory as ANN_Qk.ipynb.
Source: USGS Earthquake Catalog or similar.

## Run the Notebook:
Open ANN_Qk.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Run all cells to train the model, evaluate it, and visualize predictions.

## Output:
Test Mean Absolute Error (MAE) displayed in the notebook.
Interactive geographical scatter plot showing actual vs. predicted magnitudes.

## Model Details
Architecture:
Input layer: Matches feature count (e.g., 7 features).
Hidden layers: 64 neurons (ReLU), 32 neurons (ReLU).
Output layer: 1 neuron (linear) for regression.
Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Optimizer: Adam.
Training: 50 epochs, batch size 128, 20% validation split.

## Results
Test MAE: [Insert your MAE here, e.g., 0.45] magnitude units (based on a single train-test split).
See the notebook for detailed outputs and visualizations.

## Next Steps
Enhance accuracy with additional features (e.g., tectonic plate data).
Deploy the model for real-time predictions.
Explore cross-validation for robustness.
